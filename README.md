# G.js Project
Welcome to the G.js project, which the goal of is to allow you to easily create trigger logic, deco, or anything purposed for GD using JavaScript/TypeScript.

# Why JS?
At first, the choice of using JS for this project might sound stupid, but there are reasons:
- The ecosystem is very large, meaning you won't have a super hard time finding tools specifically for your GD project
- It's an easy language to learn
- It's one of the faster interpreted languages

# Why use this instead of something like SPWN?
While SPWN is a quite well-known and beloved project, it has its flaws: it's no longer maintained by the developers due to many factors, it's EXTREMELY slow, it can't do much without the assistance of another language and it has bare to no support for 2.2 objects. 

G.js tries to fix these flaws for something at least somewhat more usable for SPWN if you would like to write programs for non-trigger-related things.

# How do I use G.js?
If you have experience in SPWN, this should be much easier, as SPWN was the original syntax inspiration, though parts of the syntax have been changed to fit JS syntax. You can start by reading the [Usage section](https://github.com/g-js-api/G.js#Usage), which highlights some of the syntax differences from SPWN, and use the [Docs](https://g-js-api.github.io/G.js/) to gather information about how G.js's methods & classes are supposed to be used + info about object properties, particle properties & event IDs.
